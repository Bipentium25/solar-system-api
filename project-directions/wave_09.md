# Wave 09: Deployment

## Set Up

1. The Solar System API should be in a working state, such that running `$ flask run` does not produce any errors. To the best of your ability, you should check that no syntax errors, name errors, or other runtime errors occur.
2. All code for Solar System API should be pushed to GitHub.

## Deploying Solar System

1. As a pair or group, follow the "Deploying to Render" walk-through step-by-step together.
2. When any errors or questions arise:
    - Write down what step/command just created the issue
    - Write down how you observed the issue
    - Pause, debug, and ask for help!

When done, answer the following questions with your pair or small group:
1. If you and/or your group had successful deployment, how did you and/or your group verify the deployment?
2. How would you describe the relationship between our projects, git, and Render?
3. Poke around the Render dashboard. What is a feature that looks interesting or curious?
4. How would you describe the overall development workflow, from the beginning of a project, to deployment?
5. How would you like to celebrate a successful deployment?
